The `gh-pages` branch houses the hosted version of Bootstrap's documentation ([getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)).
This branch is normally managed by the [Bootstrap Core Team](http://getbootstrap.com/about/#team) and normally should not be modified by other contributors.

You should modify the documentation source files in [the `/bootstrap/docs` directory of the `master` branch](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/docs) instead.
