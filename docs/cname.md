The `/bootstrap/CNAME` file controls the [custom domain configuration of GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/), which is used for hosting Bootstrap's documentation at [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/about/#team)

Unless the Bootstrap project decides to switch to a different Internet domain name for some reason, **this file should never be modified by anyone**.
