The files in [`/bootstrap/dist/js/`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/dist/css) are automatically generated from the files in [`/bootstrap/js/`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/js) via a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) task, and **should not be edited manually** when developing Bootstrap itself. Any such edits will be **overwritten and lost** the next time the Grunt task runs.

You should edit the files in [`/bootstrap/js/`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/js) instead.
